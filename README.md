## 👋 Hi, I’m Axel Van Dyck - @avandyck16

🌟 About Me

I’m a bilingual QA Tester with experience in the educational and business sectors. Passionate about creating efficient workflows and leveraging modern QA tools like Azure DevOps, JIRA, Postman, Python, and SQL to ensure top-notch product quality.

I have a sharp eye for detail and a knack for hunting bugs to prevent issues, improve product quality, and reduce error rates. Plus, I find it fun to tell developers when they’ve made a mistake—always with kindness and a collaborative mindset!

🚀 What I’m Working On  

So far, I've been actively participating in around 8 projects, including a social betting app, cosmetics and medical prostheses development and management, urban transportation, media sharing, and third-party logistics; developing more than 350 test scenarios and diverse strategies at logic, functionality, and design to harness data and put my hands and brain to work to excel at product quality. 

Setting my focus on manual testing, as I keep diving deeper into Python, automation, and QA Testing to sharpen my skills.  
Exploring the technical universe and software development to expand my horizons.  

🤝 Collaboration  

I’m open to working on projects—big or small— and being part of a structured team in which I can bring expertise in QA testing, and that can help me grow and make a greater impact. Whether it’s developing automation scripts, improving testing workflows, or building QA strategies, I’m ready to contribute.
