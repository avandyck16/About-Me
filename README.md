👋 Hi, I’m @avandyck16

🌟 About Me
I’m a bilingual QA Engineer with experience in the educational and business sectors. Passionate about creating efficient workflows and leveraging modern QA tools like Azure DevOps, JIRA, Postman, Charles, Python, and SQL to ensure top-notch product quality.

I have a sharp eye for detail and a knack for hunting bugs to prevent issues, improve product quality, and reduce error rates. Plus, I find it fun to tell developers when they’ve made a mistake—always with kindness and a collaborative mindset!

🚀 What I’m Working On
Diving deeper into Python, automation, and QA Testing to sharpen my skills.
Exploring machine learning and software development to expand my horizons.
🤝 Collaboration
I’m open to working on projects—big or small—that can help me grow and make an impact. Whether it’s developing automation scripts, improving testing workflows, or building QA strategies, I’m ready to contribute.
