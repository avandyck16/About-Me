- 👋 Hi, I’m @avandyck16
- 👀 I’m interested in software coding, machine learning, and quality testing. It's kinda fun to tell developers that they have made a mistake!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, automation, and digging deeper into QA Testing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on either small or big projects that can help me build experience and skills.
- 📫 How to reach me? Check my LinkedIn profile. linkedin.com/in/axelvandyck
- 😄 Fun fact: I'm kind of introvert and insecure but I can learn how to use any software in a couple of days like a pro. I learned how to model in 3D for a videogame
- by myself just by playing around with the software and the game.
