- 👋 Hi, I’m @avandyck16
- 👀 I’m interested in software, machine learning, and quality testing. It's kinda fun to tell developers that they have made a mistake!
- 🌱 I’m digging deeper into Python, automation, and QA Testing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on either small or big projects that can help me build experience and skills.

- 😄 Fun fact: I'm an introvert who can learn how to use any software in a couple of days almost like a pro. 
                I learned how to model in 3D for a videogame by myself just by playing around with the software and the game,
                and learned how to play around with a machine through command lines.
